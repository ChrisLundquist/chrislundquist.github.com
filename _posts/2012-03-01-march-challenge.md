## Big Ideas

1. **Create an Open source load balancing API**

  Basically a wrapper around HA proxy and your application that needs it.

2. **Write a WebGL graphing library.**

  Seems like the barrier to use WebGL could be lower.

3. **Write a binary gem building system.**

  In reference to Katz's speech at Ruby on Ales.
