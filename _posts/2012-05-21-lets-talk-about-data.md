# Data types

let's talk about data.

Most data is really boils down to just a few types. There are strings,
integers, and floats for the most part. Strings are, well, a string
of characters or letters naturally. Integers are whole numbers. Floats
are decimal numbers.

##Some examples of strings.

* "a" a simple string

* "hello world" my favorite string

* "\n\t\e\d" a string of special characters. newline, tab, escape, backspace

##Some examples of integers

* 2 a positive whole number

* 0 zero

* -5 a negative number

##Some examples of Floats

* 1.123 some decimal

* 3.1415927 some of pi

* -1.0 a negative number that is equal to the integer -1

# Complex Data Types
Sometimes there is a certain type of data we use over and over again. Usually
when this happens we make some standard for it. Some examples like this are
Timestamps, Regexp, Arrays, Hashes
